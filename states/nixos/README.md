This is very much a work-in-progress.

(Some) TODOs
- [ ] LUKS set-up
- [ ] validate on macos
- [ ] remove KDE/gnome leftovers
- [ ] set-up declarative coc-nvim
- [ ] set-up xautolocker and such


Notes:
- ended up using -unstable for userspace
- had to manually install gopls


Usage:
```bash
./bootstrap <profile>
```
