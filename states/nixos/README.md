This is very much a work-in-progress.

(Some) TODOs

- [ ] KDE plasma configuration
- [ ] Konsole configuration
- [ ] LUKS set-up
- [ ] document home-manager bootstrapping
- [ ] (neo)vim set-up
- [ ] remainder of misc dotfiles set-up
- [ ] validate on macos


Notes:
- ended up using -unstable for userspace
- had to manually install gopls
